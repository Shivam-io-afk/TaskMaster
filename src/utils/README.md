# Error Indicator Utility for TaskMaster REACT

## Overview

This utility provides a modern, user-friendly way to display alerts in the TaskMaster REACT application. It uses the `ErrIndic.js` component to show visually appealing notifications to users.

## Features

- Four alert types: error, success, info, and warning
- Auto-dismissing alerts with animation
- Consistent styling with the application design
- Easy to use API

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import { showAlert } from '../utils/errorUtils';

// Show an error alert
showAlert('This is an error message', 'error');

// Show a success alert
showAlert('Operation completed successfully', 'success');

// Show an info alert
showAlert('Here is some information', 'info');

// Show a warning alert
showAlert('Be careful with this action', 'warning');
```

## Alert Types

- `error` - Red alert for errors (default if no type is specified)
- `success` - Green alert for successful operations
- `info` - Blue alert for informational messages
- `warning` - Orange alert for warnings

## Implementation in LoginPage

The error indicator has been integrated into the LoginPage component to provide feedback to users during the login, signup, and password reset processes:

- Login form validation
- Signup form validation (password matching, password strength)
- Password reset confirmation
- Google authentication status

This implementation maintains the original design, placement, and layout of the error indicator as specified.
